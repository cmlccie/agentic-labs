# Lab Instructions

- Labs are designed to be completed in 15-30 minutes.
- Labs are self-contained and do not depend on each other.
- Labs are designed to be run in a terminal environment.
- Emphasis on using open-source models and libraries.
- Use simple and approachable concepts and language.
- Use concise, clear language.
- Use active voice.
- Provide step-by-step instructions.
- Don't include code from a lab's scripts; if necessary, refer the learner to code in the lab scripts.
- Use the tell, show, tell method for instructions: tell the user what they will see, walk them through running the code, and then tell them what they just saw.
- Experimentation is encouraged, and users should feel free to modify and extend the code.
